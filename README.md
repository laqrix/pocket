Inspired by [PocketMod](http://www.pocketmod.com/), these are LaTeX
templates for creating your own folding organizers.

1. Replace the content of `example.tex`
2. Run `make`
3. Print `pocket3.pdf`
4. Trim edges, fold, and cut

I recommend using a "Shrink to Printable Area" setting when printing.

Printers don't print exactly square on the page because of their
feeder mechanisms.  For some reason, when comparing my results with a
known good PocketMod, my results are consistently off by about 1/8".
